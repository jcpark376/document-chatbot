#### Project Title: 
Investigating the Effect of RNAi on Lifespan Extension in *Caenorhabditis elegans*

---

**Objective:**  
The goal of this experiment is to investigate the impact of gene knockdown using RNA interference (RNAi) on lifespan extension in *C. elegans*. Specifically, the gene daf-2 (encoding for an insulin/IGF-1 receptor) is targeted, as previous research suggests its role in longevity pathways. Worms will be exposed to bacteria expressing daf-2 RNAi, and survival will be monitored over time.

---

**Materials and Methods:**

- **Strain:** *C. elegans* N2 (wild type) and JK1107 (daf-16::GFP reporter strain)
- **Bacteria:** HT115 *E. coli* expressing daf-2 RNAi plasmid and empty vector (control)
- **Media:** NGM plates supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 25 μg/mL carbenicillin
- **Incubation Conditions:** 20°C, with ~50 worms per plate (3 replicates for each condition)
- **Age of Worms at Start:** L4 stage
- **Control:** HT115 *E. coli* with an empty vector
- **Microscopy:** GFP fluorescence will be assessed for nuclear localization of DAF-16 using a fluorescent microscope on days 1, 5, and 10.

**Procedure:**

1. **Preparation of RNAi Plates:**  
   a. Prepared fresh RNAi and control plates by seeding NGM plates with HT115 bacteria carrying daf-2 RNAi or empty vector plasmid.  
   b. Plates were left overnight at room temperature to allow bacterial growth.

2. **Synchronization of Worms:**  
   a. Synchronized N2 and JK1107 worms using hypochlorite bleaching.  
   b. Transferred L4 stage worms (~50 per plate) onto RNAi or control plates.

3. **Incubation:**  
   a. Plates incubated at 20°C in standard conditions.  
   b. Worms were transferred every 2 days to prevent progeny contamination.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   a. Checked worm survival daily and recorded dead worms.  
   b. Assessed lifespan data using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

5. **Fluorescence Microscopy (JK1107 Strain):**  
   a. GFP expression in JK1107 worms was observed at days 1, 5, and 10 post RNAi exposure.  
   b. Noted the nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP as an indicator of DAF-2 knockdown efficiency.

**Observations:**

- **Day 1:**  
  Worms are active in both control and RNAi conditions. Initial GFP fluorescence in JK1107 shows predominantly cytoplasmic DAF-16 localization.

- **Day 3:**  
  No significant mortality observed in either group. JK1107 worms in the daf-2 RNAi group begin to show nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP, indicating activation of the DAF-16 pathway.

- **Day 7:**  
  Slight increase in mortality observed in control worms compared to RNAi-treated worms. DAF-16::GFP localization becomes more pronounced in the RNAi-treated worms, with clear nuclear localization.

- **Day 10:**  
  Notable lifespan extension observed in RNAi-treated worms. Control group showing higher mortality, while RNAi group maintains good vitality. Fluorescent microscopy continues to show nuclear GFP signal in JK1107 strain.

---

**Preliminary Results:**

- daf-2 RNAi-treated worms exhibit significant nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP, consistent with successful knockdown of daf-2 and activation of longevity pathways.
- Initial lifespan data suggests an extended lifespan in RNAi-treated worms compared to controls, though full Kaplan-Meier analysis is pending further data collection.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Continue lifespan monitoring for full cohort.
2. Perform statistical analysis (Log-rank test) on survival data.
3. Investigate expression levels of DAF-16 target genes using qPCR.
4. Plan for replicating the experiment in a different environmental condition (15°C vs 25°C).

**Notes:**  
Some plates had slight bacterial overgrowth, potentially affecting food intake. Will adjust bacterial concentrations in the next run to ensure consistent results.
